# True Crime Tracking App - Design System

## Project Overview

A comprehensive design system for a Netflix-style True Crime tracking app that helps enthusiasts discover, track, and organize content across 200+ streaming services and cable networks. The design prioritizes sensitivity, accessibility, and user safety while delivering an engaging experience for True Crime content consumption.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Respectful Design**: Acknowledge the sensitive nature of True Crime content with appropriate visual treatments and content warnings
- **Information Clarity**: Distinguish between factual documentaries and dramatized content through clear visual hierarchy
- **Privacy First**: Design with user privacy and safety as foundational requirements
- **Accessibility Focus**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with trauma-informed design considerations
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Maintain unified experience across mobile and web platforms

### Visual Identity

- **Sophisticated Dark Theme**: Primary experience optimized for evening viewing with comfortable contrast ratios
- **Muted Color Palette**: Respectful colors that avoid sensationalism while maintaining visual interest
- **Clean Typography**: Clear hierarchy that supports information scanning and reduces cognitive load
- **Subtle Motion**: Purposeful animations that enhance usability without distraction

## Design Considerations for True Crime Content

### Content Sensitivity
- **Trauma-Informed Design**: Avoid graphic imagery, use content warnings, provide user control over sensitive content exposure
- **Factual Accuracy**: Clear visual distinction between documentaries, dramatizations, and fictional content
- **Victim Respect**: Design patterns that honor victims and their families while serving user needs

### User Safety & Privacy
- **Default Privacy**: All social features are opt-in by default with granular privacy controls
- **Content Warnings**: Systematic approach to content warnings and user preferences
- **Safe Spaces**: Community guidelines and moderation tools built into the design system

### Platform Integration
- **Streaming Service APIs**: Deep-linking patterns and fallback behaviors for 200+ services
- **Cable Network Integration**: TV scheduling and recording functionality
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Consistent experience across mobile and web platforms

## Success Metrics Integration

Design decisions support key success metrics:
- **70% MAU**: Intuitive navigation and engaging discovery patterns
- **4+ sessions/week**: Quick-access patterns and personalized recommendations
- **15+ tracked shows**: Efficient tracking workflows and bulk management tools
- **60% 6-month retention**: Progressive feature disclosure and community building
- **30% social participation**: Privacy-respecting social design patterns
