# Case-Based Content Organization Experience Design

## Feature Overview

The case-based organization feature transforms how True Crime enthusiasts discover and organize content by focusing on specific criminal cases rather than traditional genre browsing. This feature enables users to explore comprehensive coverage of cases they're interested in, track content across multiple formats (documentaries, dramatizations, podcasts), and understand the relationships between different treatments of the same story.

## User Experience Analysis

### Primary User Goal

Users want to organize and discover True Crime content by specific cases or suspects so they can deep-dive into particular stories and find comprehensive coverage across all available platforms and content types.

### Success Criteria

- Users can easily find all content related to a specific case across platforms
- Case profiles provide comprehensive information without sensationalizing
- Content relationships are clear (source material, different perspectives, fact vs. fiction)
- Users can track their progress across all content for a case
- Case-based recommendations lead to discovery of related cases and content

### Key Pain Points Addressed

- **Fragmented Case Coverage**: Eliminates need to search multiple platforms for content about the same case
- **Content Type Confusion**: Clear distinction between factual documentaries and dramatized recreations
- **Missing Context**: Provides background information and timeline context for complex cases
- **Content Duplication**: Identifies when different shows cover the same case or events
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Highlights gaps in case coverage and notifies about new releases

### User Personas Served

- **Primary**: Research-minded viewers who want comprehensive case knowledge
- **Secondary**: Casual fans interested in following specific high-profile cases
- **Tertiary**: Content creators and podcasters researching case details
- **Quaternary**: Academic researchers studying criminal psychology and case patterns

## Information Architecture

### Content Hierarchy

1. **Case Overview** - Basic case information, timeline, key participants
2. **Content Library** - All available content organized by type and chronology
3. **Case Timeline** - Interactive timeline showing both case events and content releases
4. **Related Cases** - Similar cases, connected suspects, or case series
5. **Content Analysis** - Fact vs. fiction breakdowns, source material comparisons
6. **Community Insights** - User discussions, fact corrections, additional resources

### Navigation Structure

Case organization follows a hub-and-spoke model with the case profile as the central hub:

- **Case Discovery**: Search, browse by category, or discover through recommendations
- **Case Profile**: Central information hub with content organization
- **Content Detail**: Individual content pages with case context
- **Cross-Case Navigation**: Easy movement between related cases
- **Personal Case Tracking**: User's followed cases and progress tracking

### Mental Model Alignment

Users approach this as "researching a case" similar to:

- Wikipedia case articles with comprehensive information and references
- Documentary film research with multiple source materials
- Academic case studies with primary and secondary sources
- News coverage following a story over time with multiple perspectives

The interface mirrors research patterns while maintaining entertainment value and accessibility.

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

1. **Level 1**: Basic case information and primary content recommendations
2. **Level 2**: Detailed timeline, content categorization, and user tracking
3. **Level 3**: Comprehensive content analysis, fact checking, and community features
4. **Level 4**: Advanced research tools, cross-case analysis, and academic resources
5. **Level 5**: Expert mode with primary source materials and investigative tools
