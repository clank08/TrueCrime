# Content Discovery Experience Design

## Feature Overview

The content discovery feature serves as the heart of the True Crime tracking app, enabling users to search, browse, and discover relevant content across all connected streaming platforms and cable networks. This unified interface eliminates the need to search each platform individually while providing intelligent recommendations based on user interests and viewing history.

## User Experience Analysis

### Primary User Goal
True Crime enthusiasts want to efficiently discover content about specific cases, killers, or topics across all their platforms, with clear availability information and direct access to watch immediately.

### Success Criteria
- Search results appear in under 100ms via Meilisearch
- 95% deep-link success rate to correct platform and episode
- Users discover average 5+ new titles per session
- 80% of searches result in content being added to tracking
- Average session time increases 40% post-onboarding

### Key Pain Points Addressed
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Single search across all connected services
- **Content Overwhelm**: Intelligent filtering by availability, genre, and user preferences
- **Discovery Fatigue**: Personalized recommendations based on viewing history and interests
- **Access Friction**: Direct deep-linking to content with platform fallbacks

### User Personas Served
- **Primary**: Sarah discovers new Ted Bundy documentaries across her 6 streaming services
- **Secondary**: Mike finds Investigation Discovery shows available on his cable package
- **Tertiary**: Jessica researches comprehensive coverage of the Golden State Killer case across all platforms

## Information Architecture

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Search Results** - Relevance-ranked content matching user query
2. **Filter Categories** - Platform, genre, content type, release date, case type
3. **Content Cards** - Title, platform availability, content warnings, user ratings
4. **Detailed Views** - Synopsis, cast, related content, user reviews, watch options

### Navigation Structure
- **Primary Navigation**: Search bar always accessible, filter toggles, sort options
- **Secondary Navigation**: Content type tabs (All, Documentaries, Series, Podcasts)
- **Contextual Navigation**: Related content suggestions, case connections, platform filtering

### Mental Model Alignment
Users approach content discovery similar to:
- **Netflix browsing** with personalized recommendations and infinite scroll
- **Google search** with instant results and refined queries
- **TV guide exploration** with time-based and network-based filtering

The interface combines the immediacy of search with the serendipity of browsing, matching user mental models from familiar platforms.

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy
1. **Level 1**: Basic search with top results and platform availability
2. **Level 2**: Filtering options and content type refinement
3. **Level 3**: Advanced filters (production year, rating, case specifics)
4. **Level 4**: Related content exploration and case-based organization
5. **Level 5**: Community ratings, discussions, and advanced recommendations
