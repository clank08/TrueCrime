# Smart Notifications & Alerts Experience Design

## Feature Overview

The smart notification system transforms passive content consumption into active engagement by intelligently alerting users about new content for cases they follow, upcoming cable programming, social activity from friends, and personalized recommendations. The system prioritizes user control and relevance while respecting the sensitive nature of True Crime content and avoiding notification fatigue.

## User Experience Analysis

### Primary User Goal

Users want to be notified about new content for cases they follow and other relevant True Crime releases without being overwhelmed by notifications or receiving inappropriate alerts during sensitive times.

### Success Criteria

- Users receive timely notifications about genuinely relevant new content
- Notification timing respects user preferences and quiet hours
- Alert content is appropriate and never sensationalized
- Users can easily customize notification frequency and types
- Notifications enhance rather than interrupt the user experience

### Key Pain Points Addressed

- **Missing New Content**: Automatic alerts prevent missing relevant releases across platforms
- **Information Overload**: Smart filtering prevents notification fatigue through relevance scoring
- **Poor Timing**: Customizable quiet hours and frequency controls respect user schedules
- **Inappropriate Content**: Content warnings and sensitivity filters prevent disturbing notifications
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Unified notifications across streaming services and cable networks

### User Personas Served

- **Primary**: Busy professionals who want to stay updated without constant app checking
- **Secondary**: Dedicated True Crime fans who follow specific cases intensively  
- **Tertiary**: Social users who want friend activity updates with privacy respect
- **Quaternary**: Cable viewers who need TV schedule reminders and availability alerts

## Information Architecture

### Notification Categories

1. **Content Alerts** - New releases, availability changes, recommendations
2. **Case Updates** - New content for followed cases, case developments, anniversaries
3. **Social Activity** - Friend sharing, community discussions (with privacy respect)
4. **Platform Notifications** - Availability changes, expiring content, deep link updates
5. **System Updates** - App updates, feature announcements, maintenance notifications
6. **Emergency Alerts** - Safety concerns, content warnings, service disruptions

### Notification Hierarchy

**Immediate Priority**: Content warnings, safety alerts, time-sensitive availability
**High Priority**: New content for followed cases, friend recommendations, expiring content
**Medium Priority**: New releases in preferred genres, social activity, platform updates
**Low Priority**: General recommendations, system updates, educational content

### User Control Architecture

All notifications controlled through granular preference system:

- **Global Controls**: Master notification toggle with temporary quiet modes
- **Category Controls**: Separate toggles for each notification type
- **Timing Controls**: Quiet hours, frequency limits, and delivery preferences
- **Content Filters**: Sensitivity levels, case filters, and content type preferences
- **Platform Controls**: Per-service notification settings with availability focus

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

1. **Level 1**: Basic new content alerts for tracked shows and followed cases
2. **Level 2**: Platform availability notifications and expiring content alerts
3. **Level 3**: Social activity updates and community engagement notifications
4. **Level 4**: Advanced recommendation engine with predictive content alerts
5. **Level 5**: Expert mode with real-time case updates and professional tools

## Implementation Notes

The notification system must balance timely content delivery with respect for the sensitive nature of True Crime material. All notifications should enhance user engagement without creating anxiety, sensationalism, or inappropriate interruptions.

Special attention to trauma-informed design ensures notifications never cause distress through poor timing, insensitive language, or inappropriate content warnings. The system should feel helpful and respectful rather than intrusive or sensationalized.

User control is paramount - users should feel confident they can customize or disable any notifications without missing genuinely important content or losing app functionality.
