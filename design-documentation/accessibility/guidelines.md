# Accessibility Standards and Guidelines

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive accessibility standards for the True Crime tracking app, ensuring equal access for all users regardless of ability. Our approach combines WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with trauma-informed design principles, recognizing the sensitive nature of True Crime content and its potential impact on users with various accessibility needs.

## Design Philosophy for Accessibility

### Universal Design Principles

**Inclusive by Default**: Every feature is designed to work for the broadest possible range of users from the outset, rather than retrofitted for accessibility compliance.

**Trauma-Informed Accessibility**: Accessibility features consider the emotional impact of True Crime content, providing additional control and warning systems for users with trauma-related sensitivities.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without assistive technology, with enhanced experiences layered on top for users who can benefit from them.

**Context-Aware Design**: Interface adaptations respect user preferences and environmental contexts, particularly important for evening viewing when True Crime consumption peaks.

### Accessibility Statement

We are committed to ensuring that our True Crime tracking app provides an inclusive experience for all users. This includes people with:
- Visual impairments (blindness, low vision, color vision deficiencies)
- Hearing impairments (deafness, hard of hearing)
- Motor impairments (limited fine motor control, mobility restrictions)
- Cognitive disabilities (memory issues, attention disorders, learning disabilities)
- Temporary impairments (broken arm, bright environment, noisy surroundings)
- Trauma-related sensitivities (PTSD, anxiety disorders, phobias)

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Standards

### Principle 1: Perceivable

#### 1.1 Text Alternatives
**Standard**: All non-text content has text alternatives that serve the equivalent purpose.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **Content Images**: All poster images include alt text with title, year, and content type
  ```
  Example: "Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (2019) - Documentary Series"
  ```
- **Decorative Images**: Use empty alt attributes (`alt=""`) for purely decorative elements
- **Complex Images**: Charts and infographics include detailed descriptions or data tables
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons and controls have descriptive labels
- **Content Warnings**: Visual warning badges include text equivalents in alt text

**True Crime Specific Considerations**:
- **Sensitive Images**: Alt text for case-related imagery avoids graphic descriptions while providing necessary context
- **Victim Photos**: Respectful alt text focuses on memorial or investigative context rather than personal details
- **Evidence Images**: Clinical, factual descriptions without sensationalizing content

#### 1.2 Time-based Media
**Standard**: Provide alternatives for time-based media.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **Video Content**: Closed captions for all video content including trailers and promotional materials
- **Audio Content**: Transcripts available for podcast episodes and audio-only content
- **Live Content**: Real-time captions for live streaming content or events
- **Sign Language**: Sign language interpretation for key video content where appropriate

**Platform Integration**:
- **Streaming Services**: Respect user caption preferences across platform deep-links
- **Audio Descriptions**: Support for audio described content where available from platforms
- **Playback Controls**: Accessible playback speed controls for users with cognitive needs

#### 1.3 Adaptable
**Standard**: Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H6) throughout application
- **Reading Order**: Logical content order when CSS styling is removed
- **Programmatic Relationships**: Form labels properly associated with inputs
- **Orientation Support**: Content works in both portrait and landscape orientations
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts meaningfully across screen sizes

**Content Structure**:
```html
<!-- Proper heading hierarchy example -->
<h1>True Crime Library</h1>
  <h2>Currently Watching</h2>
    <h3>Conversations with a Killer</h3>
      <h4>Season 1, Episode 3</h4>
```

**Information Hierarchy**:
- **Content Cards**: Information remains accessible when visual styling removed
- **Filter Controls**: Logical grouping of related filter options
- **Navigation**: Consistent navigation structure across all screens
- **Form Structure**: Clear relationships between labels, inputs, and error messages

#### 1.4 Distinguishable
**Standard**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content.

**Color Contrast Requirements**:
- **Normal Text**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against background
- **Large Text** (18px+): Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- **Interactive Elements**: Minimum 3:1 contrast for buttons, form fields, focus indicators
- **Critical Actions**: Target 7:1 contrast ratio for essential interactions

**Verified Color Combinations**:
```css
/* High contrast text combinations */
.primary-text-on-dark { 
  color: #EAEAF4; /* AAA compliance: 12.6:1 on #1A1A1C */
}
.secondary-text-on-dark { 
  color: #AAAAB4; /* AA compliance: 7.2:1 on #1A1A1C */
}
.error-text { 
  color: #FF6B6B; /* AA compliance: 4.7:1 on #1A1A1C */
}
```

**Color-Independent Design**:
- **Status Indicators**: Use icons, shapes, or text in addition to color
- **Progress Indicators**: Patterns or labels supplement color coding
