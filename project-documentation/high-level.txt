True Crime App - High Level Summary
🎯 The Opportunity
Problem: True Crime fans have content scattered across 200+ streaming services AND cable networks (Investigation Discovery, Oxygen, A&E) with no way to track what they've watched or discover new content related to specific cases/killers.
Solution: The first comprehensive True Crime tracking app that consolidates streaming + cable using legitimate APIs, with social features and case-based discovery.

The MVP should generally flow like this:

Sign up → Email/social authentication
Platform selection → Choose streaming services + cable provider
Interest setup → Select favorite True Crime categories (serial killers, cold cases, etc.)
Quick tutorial → "Add your first show and rate it"
